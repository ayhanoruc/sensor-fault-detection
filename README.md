# Sensor-Fault-Detection
This is a supervised machine learning  binary classification problem focusing on detecting APS failure cases.
### Description: 
-> The Scania Air Pressure System(APS) is an integral component in heavy trucks, responsible for generating pressurized air used in vital functions such as braking and gear changing.
### Goal: 
We want to reduce the cost of maintanance checks and unnecessary repairs. So it is crucial to minimize the false predictions. 

##Solution Proposed
-> Train a successful classifier model to predict failures beforehand and maintain & scale & modulerize the project architecture. 

##Tech Stack Used
1. Python: core Python and OOP, and some common 3rd party libraries
2. FastAPI
3. Machine learning Supervised Classification algorithms
4. Docker
5. MongoDB


##Infrastructure Required.
